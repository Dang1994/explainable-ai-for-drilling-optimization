## Digitalization of Oil and Gas Industry
## Drilling Process Parameter Optimization, prediction of rate of penitrationand and drill bit failure: Advance Optimization techniques, XGboost, Explanable AI 

## üìå Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between drilling process parameters using two distinct datasets. The primary objectives are:
- EDA of drilling datasets
- Developing Explainable AI (XAI) models using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and LIME with XGBoost model.
- Predicting the Rate of Penetration (ROP) using machine learning models.
- Predicting the drill bit failure and type of failure 
- Optimizing process parameters for ROP using various optimization techniques
